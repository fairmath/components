# FHE components library

This repository is an initial phase of building an application layer FHE Components library for developers and serves as the home to the award-winning solutions from the [FHERMA](https://fherma.io/) challenges platform.
The library will be constantly extended by adding new FHE components.

The initial version of the library contains the results of the first challenges: 
- [Matrix Multiplication](https://fherma.io/challenges/652bf669485c878710fd020b/overview)
- [Logistic Regression Function](https://fherma.io/challenges/652bf648485c878710fd0208/overview)
- [Sign Evaluation](https://fherma.io/challenges/652bf668485c878710fd020a/overview)

 Check out the [FHERMA competition platform](https://fherma.io/) for innovative FHE solutions and challenges.

# FHE backend
Currently, Polycircuit supports two FHE backends:
* OpenFHE
* Lattigo

The library is designed with flexibility in mind, ensuring it's backend-agnostic.
